/**
 * Resilient selection of the outbound (cellular) network.
 *
 * The proxy must bind every upstream socket/DNS lookup to the phone's cellular
 * data interface, but the single [ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback]-held
 * reference used elsewhere can be nulled out by a transient [android.net.ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback.onLost]
 * (frequent while the device is a WiFi-Direct Group Owner). When that happens
 * all egress silently fell back to the WiFi-Direct interface (no internet),
 * taking the whole proxy down until the callback refired.
 *
 * This helper re-validates the preferred network on every use and, failing that,
 * scans [ConnectivityManager.getAllNetworks] for a cellular network that
 * actually has internet, only then falling back to the active network.
